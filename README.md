# Tessellation---GLUT
Tessellation implemented with the Ear-Clipping Algorithm. Users are able to draw an object on the screen. After the drawing, users will be able to see what the object looks like when tessellated. The users can choose to color the object after it's been tessellated, or can choose to color in the block without tessellation to see the differences.

This was a school project I completed in Mercer University when I took my first graphics class. It was a project that taught me how tessellations were implemented. It was also my first introduction to computer graphics, so I learned about model view transformations and getting color on the screen.
